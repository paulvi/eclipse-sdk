# eclipse-sdk
A packaging of the Eclipse SDK

This is not the intended or official way to consume eclipse bundles. I am working on a project that needs the bundles, but couldn't find a public repository that contains updated versions - so I started working on this. It is not yet ready, but I shall update this repository if I am able to make the bundles work for me to track more recent releases.

Published bundles can be seen e.g. via <http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.adedayo.eclipse.sdk>
